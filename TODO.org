* TODO change `browse-url' var inside doc search
  this should use make-buffer-local like the url cookie stuff

* TODO implement a delete function

* TODO reporting download

* TODO add more api entry points

* TODO write texinfo manual

* TODO consider opening Lisp buffers in elisp-mode + view-mode for `q' usage 

* TODO reimplement buffer names, this time sanely
  The names of the converted buffers should inherit from the names of
  the services/api calls that were used to generate their
  contents. This will allow the names to propagate outward/upward in a
  way that's searchable and allows me to gather all of the buffers
  related to that service/api call together via search.

* TODO modify `an-json-fields' with all the different `meta' variants

  Find them all...

  - [ ] fields
