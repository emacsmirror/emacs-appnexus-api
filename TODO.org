* TODO Update functions with comments describing their contracts

* TODO Update function docstrings

* TODO Do some general refactoring

* TODO Denote internal-only functions

  I like jao's method using `--'. See the Geiser source code for examples.

* TODO Implement a save function

  This will save the buffer as its current name, so that (for example)
  a buffer named http://sand.api.appnexus.com/member/meta.el will save
  under that name (perhaps with a timestamp?).

* TODO Implement HTTP DELETE calls

* TODO Reporting download

  Automate this multi-step process...

* TODO Write a Texinfo manual

* DONE Write a commentary in the source code
