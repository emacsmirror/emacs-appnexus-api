* Emacs + AppNexus API = Less Typing

  I don't love typing JSON, especially all the silly double-quotes and the comma placement nonsense. I don't like typing out strings on the commandline, like involved =curl= incantations. I am lazy. Therefore I'm trying to write Elisp instead of JSON, and make calls to the API using keyboard shortcuts.

** Required Packages

   =cl=
   =json=
   =url=
