* DONE reimplement buffer names, this time sanely
  CLOSED: [2012-11-30 Fri 14:43]
  The names of the converted buffers should inherit from the names of
  the services/api calls that were used to generate their
  contents. This will allow the names to propagate outward/upward in a
  way that's searchable and allows me to gather all of the buffers
  related to that service/api call together via search.
