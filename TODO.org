* TODO rename functions
  These function names are God-awful.

* TODO stop doing X->lisp conversion of the server's responses
  nothing wrong with posting the contents of lisp buffers, but there's
  no reason to require that the server's responses (which can be JSON,
  CSV, etc.) be translated into Lisp. That's why there's `buf2lsp'.

  This will make finishing the report download TODO (elsewhere in this
  list) easier.

* TODO implement a save function
  this will save the buffer as its current name, so that `http://sand.api.appnexus.com/member/meta.el' will save under that name

* TODO rename buffers with file types
  instead of " (JSON)", append a file extension ".json" for ease of saving

* TODO implement a delete function

* TODO reporting download
  automate this multi-step process

* TODO add more api entry points
  imp bus apis, etc.
  rewrite the existing `an-toggle-sand-or-prod-url' to store api URLs
  in a list (at which point the variable will probably need to be
  renamed)

* TODO write texinfo manual

* TODO modify `an-extract-meta-fields' with the different `meta' variants

* DONE change `browse-url' var inside doc search
  CLOSED: [2012-11-30 Fri 15:25]
  this should use make-buffer-local like the url cookie stuff
  (moved to `.emacs' instead)

* DONE consider opening Lisp buffers in elisp-mode + view-mode for `q' usage 
  CLOSED: [2012-11-30 Fri 15:19]
  Considered, and rejected.

* DONE reimplement buffer names, this time sanely
  CLOSED: [2012-11-30 Fri 14:43]
  The names of the converted buffers should inherit from the names of
  the services/api calls that were used to generate their
  contents. This will allow the names to propagate outward/upward in a
  way that's searchable and allows me to gather all of the buffers
  related to that service/api call together via search.
